# ReciplePlannerShoppingListMaker
This is a personal project that I like to work on in my spare time.

This program allows the user to save recipes in a digital cookbook. 
These recipes can be selected out of the cookbook to be cooked over the course of a week (one recipe per day). 
When selected, the ingredients for the recipe are populated in an interactive shopping list.
